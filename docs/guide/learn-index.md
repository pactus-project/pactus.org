Welcome to the Zarb Wiki!

## What is Zarb?

[Zarb](https://github.com/zarbchain/) is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain which is not holding any ICOs
and has no pre-minted tokens (unlike most of PoS blockchain). The participants of the blockchain
collect rewards based on their availability and honesty.

Zarb is designed from the ground up to be a “pure” blockchain protocol. Zarb has a fixed supply of
token generated at genesis which are distributed over time as block rewards to well behaving
validators who support the network by providing storage and processing power. Zarb is secured
through a novel Proof of Stake consensus mechanism whereby stake is locked on the network to prevent
any malicious or “Byzantine” behaviors that could potentially disrupt network operations.

Zarb started with 4 bootstrap validators without any stake and now anyone can join the network by
staking some tokens. The stake will be bonded and can't be touched.

A set of 21 Validators, secure the network and validate blocks. However unlike Delegated
Proof-Of-Stake (dPoS) blockchain, this set is not fix. Indeed Zarb solves validators scalability
problem with a clever and secure mechanism. Validator set in Zarb is **dynamic** and flexible
instead of fix and governed set of validators.

## Main features

- A real proof of stake blockchain without delegation
- Securing transaction by stamping transactions
- Optimizing blockchain size
- Deflationary cryptocurrency
- Secure and test oriented implementation
