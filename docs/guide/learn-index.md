# How Zarb works?



Zarb is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain which is not holding any ICOs and has no pre-minted tokens (unlike most PoS blockchain). The participants of the blockchain collect rewards based on their availability and honestly. Zarb starts at zero value and has two major phases:
- Phase 1:

    In this early phase; anyone can join the network without holding any stake.

- Phase 2:

    Validators need to stake some tokens to participate in the network and get block rewards.
