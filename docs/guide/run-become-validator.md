# Become a validator

Now, you are ready to create a full node and become a validator in Zarb network.

## Requirements

Using a linux cloud server is the best way to run a validator in Zarb network. You may get a virtual
private server from providers like Amazon, Microsoft, Linde, Alibaba, ArvanCloud, etc.

### Recommended hardwares

- Processor: Two dedicated core of CPU
- Memory: Two gigabyte of RAM
- Storage: 10 Gigabytes of free space disk
- Network: A broadband Internet connection

## üõ°Ô∏è Securing the server

The first step is securing your server. You may read this
[guid line](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/securing-your-server/) to learn hot make your sever
more secure.

## Initializing working directory

Now you need to create a working directory for you validator. A working directory is a place that
you save blockchain data, config and key files.

```
zarb init -w ~/zarb/mainnet --mainnet
```

This command creates a folder at `~/zarb`. It contains:

- Validator private key
- Genesis file
- Config file

Feel free to take a look at these files.

## Create Mintbase account

Mintbase account is the account that you receive your reward when you propose a new block. If you
don't define a Mintbase address, the rewards will goes to the same account with your validator key.
We highly recommend you to define separate address to collect your reward.

You can generate new key and update `MintbaseAddress` in config file.

```
zarb key generate
```

## Syncing blockchain

Now you can start the node and sync with the mainnet. This may take several hours:

```
zarb start -w ~/zarb/mainnet
```

## Enter committee

After syncing with the main net, you need to send a [bond transaction](./transaction-bond.md) to
bond some of your token as stake and enter the validator pool.

After you join the validator pool, the [sortition](./consensus-sortition.md)
algorithm starts working and after a while you will enter to [committee](./learn-committee).

When you enter the committee, you will have chance to propose and validate the blocks.
Any time you propose a new block, you will get the [rewards](./learn-incentive.md).


Good luck üçÄ
