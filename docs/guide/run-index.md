# How to run a Zarb node

Zarb is running its testnet right now. Mainnet will be launched soon. Until then you can join the test net:

Before joining the test-net you need to [compile](./run-compile.md) the Zarb, however if you have [Docker] in your system, you can simply pull the [Zarb docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/zarb/zarb) and start joining the test-net. Read more [here](./run-docker.md).
