# Getting Started

Welcome to the Zarb Wiki!

## What is Zarb?

[Zarb](https://github.com/zarbchain/) is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain which is not holding any ICOs and has no pre-minted tokens
(unlike most of PoS blockchains). The participants of the blockchain collect rewards based on their
availability and honesty.

In a nutshell, Zarb is Bitcoin but in Proof of Stake.

| Zarb                                             | Bitcoin                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Consensus engine is Proof of Stake               | Consensus engine is Proof of Work            |
| _Exactly_ every 10 seconds one block is _minted_ | Around every 10 minutes one block is _mined_ |
| Total supply is 21,000,000 coin                  | Total supply is 21,000,000 coin              |
| Initial block reward is 2.5 coins                | Initial block reward is 50 coin              |
| Halving happens every 16 months                  | Halving happens every 4 years                |
| Transaction fee is based on transfer amount      | Transaction fee is arbitrary                 |
| Maximum 1000 transaction per block               | Maximum block size is 1 mega byte            |

Zarb starts at zero value and with only 4 bootstrap validators. After that anyone can join the
network with staking some tokens. The stake will be bonded and can't be touched.

A set of 21 Validators, secure the network and validate blocks. However unlike Delegated
Proof-Of-Stake (dPoS) blockchais, this set is not fix. Indeed Zarb solves validators scalibility
problem with a clever and secure mechanism. Validator set in Zarb is **dynamic** and flexible
instead of fix and governed set of validators.
