# Getting Started

Welcome to the Zarb Wiki!

## What is Zarb?

[Zarb](https://github.com/zarbchain/) is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain which is not holding any ICOs and has no pre-minted tokens
(unlike most of PoS blockchains). The participants of the blockchain collect rewards based on their
availability and honesty.

In a nutshell, Zarb is a blockchain protocol layer.

Zarb is designed from the ground up to be a “pure” blockchain protocol. Like Bitcoin, Zarb
has a fixed supply of token generated at genesis which are distributed over time as block
rewards to well behaving validators who support the network by providing storage and
processing power. However, unlike BItcoin the protocol is secured through a novel Proof of
Stake consensus mechanism whereby stake is locked on the network to prevent any
malicious or “Byzantine” behaviours that could potentially disrupt network operations.
Beyond this, Zarb has extended technology and architecture advancement to ensure that it
will remain competitive in a saturated marketplace.

| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Consensus engine is Proof of Stake               | Consensus engine is Proof of Work            |
| _Exactly_ every 10 seconds one block is _minted_ | Around every 10 minutes one block is _mined_ |
| Total supply is 21,000,000 coin                  | Total supply is 21,000,000 coin              |
| Initial block reward is 2.5 coins                | Initial block reward is 50 coin              |
| Halving happens every 16 months                  | Halving happens every 4 years                |
| Transaction fee is based on transfer amount      | Transaction fee is arbitrary                 |
| Maximum 1000 transaction per block               | Maximum block size is 1 mega byte            |

Zarb starts at zero value and with only 4 bootstrap validators. After that anyone can join the
network with staking some tokens. The stake will be bonded and can't be touched.

A set of 21 Validators, secure the network and validate blocks. However unlike Delegated
Proof-Of-Stake (dPoS) blockchais, this set is not fix. Indeed Zarb solves validators scalibility
problem with a clever and secure mechanism. Validator set in Zarb is **dynamic** and flexible
instead of fix and governed set of validators.
