Welcome to the Zarb Wiki!

## What is Zarb?

Zarb is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain which is not holding any ICOs and has no pre-minted tokens
(unlike most of PoS blockchains). The participants of the blockchain collect rewards based on their
availability and honestly.

In a nutshell, Zarb is Bitcoin but in Proof of Stake.

| Zarb                                             | Bitcoin                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Consensus engine is Proof of Stake               | Consensus engine is Proof of Work            |
| _Exactly_ every 10 seconds one block is _minted_ | Around every 10 minutes one block in _mined_ |
| Total supply is 21,000,000 coin                  | Total supply is 21,000,000 coin              |
| Initial block reward is 2.5 coins                | Initial block reward is 50 coin              |
| Halving happens every 16 mounts                  | Halving happens every 4 years                |
| Transaction fee is based on transfer amount      | Transaction fee is arbitrary                 |
| Maximum 1000 transaction per block               | Maximum block size is 1 mega byte            |

Zarb starts at zero value and has two major phases:

- **Starting phase**:

  In this early phase; anyone can join the network without holding any stake.

- **Securing phase**:

  For securing the blockchain validators need to stake some tokens to participate in the network and
  get block rewards.
