To have better understanding about reward distribution, let do a comparison with bitcoin reward
distribution. We use this comparison to show the difference. We love bitcoin and bitcoin is the
king. The way bitcoin distribute the tokens is a good solution for proof of work blockchain. But in
proof of stake we need to distribute tokens more fair. Early contributors in bitcoin collect most of
the tokens, this scheme in Proof of Stake blockchain will damage the network by powering early
contributors, simply because the validators are weighed by their stake. More stake, more power.

## Treasury account

Treasury account is special account and define at the genesis time. Treasury account at the genesis
time holds total coins.

## Reward transaction

The first transaction in each block

## Flat reward

In Zarb token distribution is flat. It means the reward for each block is fixed and doesn't change
in time. There is no halving in Zarb. The flat reward is part of the consensus parameters and for
the main net it set one coin per block.
