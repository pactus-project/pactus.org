# Committee

## What is Committee?

Committee is a set of 21 validators that are responsible for producing blocks. The set is not fixed
and changes randomly. Sortition transactions change the committee members.

These rules are applied by executing sortition transactions:

1. If the validator exists inside the committee, it will be remained in the the committee.
2. If the validator doesn't exist in the committee, the last joined validator will leave the
   committee.
3. There can be more than one sortition transaction per block.
4. At least 2/3 of the total stake should be remain.
