# Send Transaction

Send transaction is used to send values between the accounts. If the receiver account does not
exist, it will be created.

Send transaction has a payload like below:

```go
type SendPayload struct {
   Sender   Address // 21 bytes
   Receiver Address // 21 bytes
   Amount   int64   // variant
}
```

## Subsidy transaction

Subsidy transaction is the first transaction in each block. There is only one subsidy transaction
per block and the format of subsidy transaction is the same as send transaction but the fee is zero.

Sender address is the [Treasury address](/learn/crypto.md#treasury-address) and receiver address is
defined by the block proposer. The amount of subsidy transaction should be equal to the block
rewards plus transactions fee. This amount will go to the recevier account as block reward.
