## What is Zarb?

Zarb is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain which is not holding any ICOs and has no pre-minted tokens
(unlike most PoS blockchains). The participants of the blockchain collect rewards based on their
availability and honesty.

Zarb is designed from the ground-up to be a “pure” blockchain protocol. It has a fixed supply of
tokens generated at genesis. These tokens are distributed over time as block rewards to
well-behaving validators who support the network by providing storage and processing power. Zarb is
secured through a novel Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism whereby stake is locked on the network to
prevent any malicious or “Byzantine” behaviors that could potentially disrupt network operations.

Zarb started with 4 bootstrap validators without any stake and now anyone can join the network by
staking some tokens. The stake will be bonded and cannot be touched. A set of 21 validators secure
the network and validate blocks. However, unlike Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) blockchain, this
set is not fixed. Indeed, Zarb solves validators' scalability problem with a clever and secure
mechanism. The set of validators in Zarb are **dynamic** and flexible, compared to the more fixed
and governed set of validators.
