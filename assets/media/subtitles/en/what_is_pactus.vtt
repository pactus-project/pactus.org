00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.262
What is Pactus Blockchain?

2
00:00:02.347 --> 00:00:07.415
Pactus is powered by a real Proof of stake consensus mechanism.

3
00:00:07.955 --> 00:00:11.444
Pactus has an unlimited pool of validators that

4
00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:16.417
anyone can become a validator by staking some coins.

5
00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:21.875
On the other hand, there is a committee of validators that generates new blocks.

6
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:25.784
The size of the committee is fixed to 21 validators.

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.632
However the committee members are not fixed and they can change randomly.

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.591
But how does this change happen?

9
00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:38.269
Pactus has a cryptographic sortition algorithm that

10
00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.502
changes the committee members.

11
00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:42.715
In each block,

12
00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:47.143
each validator generates one and only one random number

13
00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:51.190
between zero and the total stake.

14
00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:56.742
If the generated number is less than the validators' stake,

15
00:00:56.742 --> 00:01:01.820
the validator will be nominated to be inside the committee for the next block

16
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:04.962
and the last validator in the committee will leave the committee.

17
00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:06.057
For example,

18
00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:08.003
consider the situation that

19
00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.599
100 coins have been staked so far,

20
00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:18.915
Alice has staked 30 coins, Bob 20 coins, Carol 25 coins and so on and so on.

21
00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:23.434
Validators start generating random numbers between zero and 100.

22
00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:27.692
Remember that the total stake is 100.

23
00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:34.551
Carol can generate a random number less than her stake which is 15.

24
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:40.404
Therefore she can enter the committee on the next block.

25
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:45.866
As you can see the chance of entering the committee depends on the amount of stake.

26
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:50.807
If you have more stakes, therefore you have more chances to enter the committee.

27
00:01:50.808 --> 00:01:54.000
This sortition algorithm repeats per block.

28
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:58.694
When a validator joins the committee, it has a chance to propose a block

29
00:01:58.694 --> 00:02:02.481
and if the block is accepted by other committee members,

30
00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:06.865
the proposer will receive one coin as block reward.

31
00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:10.639
Transactions in Pactus Blockchain are stamped.

32
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.443
Stamping transaction simply means putting something from the previous block

33
00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:16.550
(like block ID)

34
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.949
into the header of the transaction.

35
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.165
Stamping the transactions has some benefits, like:

36
00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:25.742
the stamped transactions are loyal to the main chain

37
00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:29.168
and therefore the blockchain becomes immune against attacks

38
00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:33.984
like Long-Range attack which is very deadly for Proof of Stake blockchains.

39
00:02:33.984 --> 00:02:37.770
Also stamped transactions have a lifetime

40
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.260
and they are valid only for one day.

41
00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:46.840
The economic model in Pactus is almost similar to Bitcoin.

42
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.297
The total supply in the Pactus Blockchain is 21 million coins

43
00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:56.294
and therefore Pactus is a deflationary cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin).

44
00:02:56.294 --> 00:03:00.000
So the value of the coins should increase by time,

45
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.166
since the number of coins is limited.

46
00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.559
In order to achieve that,

47
00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:09.134
there is a special account in the genesis block which is called “Treasury account”.

48
00:03:09.134 --> 00:03:13.538
The Treasury account has 21 million coins at the genesis time,

49
00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:16.605
and no one has access to the treasury account.

50
00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:17.802
In each block,

51
00:03:17.802 --> 00:03:24.256
one coin from the treasury account will move to the block proposer as block reward.

52
00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:29.388
Unlike bitcoin which has a halving mechanism for block reward,

53
00:03:29.388 --> 00:03:34.490
block reward in Pactus is fixed and it is always one coin per block.

54
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.802
After 21 million blocks or almost 6 and half years the rewards will be finished.

55
00:03:41.802 --> 00:03:48.475
However the validators can be incentivized by the transaction fees at that time.

56
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:52.226
Since the block reward is fixed,

57
00:03:52.226 --> 00:03:56.518
the token distribution in Pactus is linear compared to Bitcoin.

58
00:03:56.518 --> 00:03:59.207
This is a fair and good mechanism for token distribution

59
00:03:59.207 --> 00:04:01.924
in a Proof of Stake blockchain.

60
00:04:01.924 --> 00:04:05.935
Since the validators are powered by stakes (or coins)

61
00:04:05.935 --> 00:04:11.186
there is a good motivation for validators to join the network earlier.

62
00:04:11.186 --> 00:04:14.490
Transaction fees in Pactus are fixed and

63
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:19.369
calculated based on the transferred values (not transferred bits).

64
00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:22.091
There is a consensus between validators to

65
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:25.244
define the percentage and minimum fee amount.

66
00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:30.161
The minimum fee amount secures the network against spam transactions.

67
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.836
Pactus starts with only 4 bootstrap validators.

68
00:04:33.836 --> 00:04:36.952
These bootstrap validators have no stake.

69
00:04:36.952 --> 00:04:39.947
Whenever the 21st validator joins the network,

70
00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.418
these bootstrap validators will be retired and

71
00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:45.671
the network will be secured by other validators.

72
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:52.275
In this time the new validators can join the committee by running the sortition algorithm.

73
00:04:54.223 --> 00:04:59.897
Running a validator in Pactus is easy, see you there.
