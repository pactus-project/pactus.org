# Incentive model

## Flat Reward

The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest[^first]. To have a better understanding about
the incentive model in Zarb, let's do a comparison with the Bitcoin incentive and reward
distribution model. We will use this comparison to show the difference. is the king.

| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Consensus engine is Proof of Stake               | Consensus engine is Proof of Work            |
| _Exactly_ every 10 seconds one block is _minted_ | Around every 10 minutes one block is _mined_ |
| Total supply is 21,000,000 coin                  | Total supply is 21,000,000 coin              |
| Always one coin per block                        | Initial block reward is 50 coin              |
| No halving                                       | Halving happens every 4 years                |

The way Bitcoin distributes the tokens is a good solution for Proof-of-Work blockchain. Early
contributors in Bitcoin collect most of the tokens. This scheme in Proof-of-Stake blockchain will
damage the network by powering early contributors. Simply because the validators are weighed by
their stake. More stake, more power.

In Pactus, the token distribution is flat. It means the reward for each block is fixed and does not
change over time. There is no halving in Pactus. The flat reward is a part of the consensus parameters
and, for the main net, it sets one coin per block.
