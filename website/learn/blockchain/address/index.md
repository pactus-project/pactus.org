# Address

## What is an Address?

An Address is a unique identifier that is used to send and receive transactions on the Pactus blockchain.
It is represented as a string of 42 alphanumeric characters and always begins with the letters "pc1".
Here is an example of an Address on the Pactus blockchain:

```text
pc1p4e92hx0erqyx939crndvthvpn7qcdhefc9r6s7
```

### Address structure

An address in the Pactus blockchain is made up of 21 bytes and it is derived from the public key.
The first byte of the address specifies the address type,
while the remaining 20 bytes represent the hash of the public key.
The hash function used is [RIPEMD-160](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD#RIPEMD-160_hashes),
which is applied after [Blake2b]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/blockchain/cryptography/#hashing-algorithm)):
The resulting byte array is then converted into a bech32m[^first] string.

### Address Type

The Address Type specifies the type of public key used to generate the address.
This makes it easy to add support for new signature algorithms in the future.
Currently, the Pactus blockchain only supports
[BLS signature]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/blockchain/cryptography/#signature-scheme)
algorithm, with the type set to one.

## Treasury address

The Treasury Address on the Pactus blockchain is a fixed address that is defined as follows:

```text
TreasuryAddress: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

The signature type for the Treasury Address is set to zero,
and the remaining characters of the address are all zeros.
