## Run a Node

An easy and effective way to help the Pactus network is to run a node.
Running Pactus blockchain is easy. Just [download](https://pactus.org/download/) the latest version of Pactus blockchain
and run it.

### What is a "Node"?

A 'node' is a software that downloads a copy of the Pactus blockchain and verifies the validity of every block,
then keeps it up-to-date with new blocks and transactions, and helps others download and update their own copies.
Nodes ensure the network keeps running safe and decentralized.

### Who should run a node?

Everyone! Nodes are not just for validators. Anyone can run a node—you don't even need stake.
Having your own node means you don't need to trust information about the state of the network provided by a third party.

<b>Don't trust. Verify.</b>
