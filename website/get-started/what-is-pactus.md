## What is Pactus?

**Pactus** is an open source and community-driven blockchain. There is no specified owner or any company structure behind it and there is no CEO who decides on its future. Instead, it is the community, for example, developers, validators or liquidity holders that own the authority in the project, determine its course of development, control resources, and make decisions.

**Pactus** is real a Proof-of-Stake blockchain which is not holding any ICOs and has no pre-minted tokens
(unlike most PoS blockchains). The participants of the blockchain collect rewards based on their
availability and honesty.

**Pactus** is designed from the ground-up to be a “pure” blockchain protocol. It has a fixed supply of
tokens generated at genesis. These tokens are distributed over time as block rewards to
well-behaving validators who support the network by providing storage and processing power. Pactus is
secured through a novel Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism whereby stake is locked on the network to
prevent any malicious or “Byzantine” behaviors that could potentially disrupt network operations.

**Pactus** started with 4 bootstrap validators without any stake and now anyone can join the network by
staking some tokens. The stake will be bonded and cannot be touched. A set of 21 validators secure
the network and validate blocks. However, unlike Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) blockchain, this
set is not fixed. Indeed, Pactus solves validators' scalability problem with a clever and secure
mechanism. The set of validators in Pactus are dynamic and flexible, compared to the fixed
and governed set of validators.
