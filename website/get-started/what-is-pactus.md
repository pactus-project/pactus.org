## What is Pactus?

**Pactus** is an open source and community-driven blockchain. There is no specified owner or any company
structure behind it and there is no CEO who decides on its future. Instead, it is the community, for example,
developers, validators or liquidity holders that own the authority in the project, determine its course of
development, control resources, and make decisions.

**Pactus** is designed from the ground-up to be a “pure” blockchain protocol. It is not holding any ICOs and
has no pre-minted tokens. It has a fixed supply of tokens generated at genesis. These tokens are distributed
over time as block rewards to well-behaving validators who support the network by providing storage and
processing power.

**Pactus** is secured through a real Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism whereby stake is locked on the network
to prevent any malicious or “Byzantine” behaviors that could potentially disrupt network operations.

**Pactus** starts with 4 bootstrap validators without any stake and anyone can join the network by
staking some tokens. A set of 21 validators secure
the network and validate blocks. However, unlike Delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) blockchain, this
set is not fixed. Indeed, Pactus solves validators' scalability problem with a clever and secure
mechanism. The set of validators in Pactus are dynamic and flexible, compared to the fixed
and governed set of validators.
