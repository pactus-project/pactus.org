## Unbond and Withdraw

- **Unbonding**: Unbonding is free. This means there are no fees associated with the process of unbonding your Pactus coins.
- **Withdrawals**: After you've unbonded your Pactus coins from staking, it will take 21 days before your coins can be withdrawn. This timeline ensures that the unbonding process is secure and that there is enough time for any potential issues to be resolved.
