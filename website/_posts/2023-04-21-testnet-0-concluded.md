## What is Testnet?

Testnet is a testing environment where developers and users can try out the functionality of a blockchain project,
without putting real assets or data at risk.
It helps to ensure that the final product is reliable and secure for users to use.
If you like to read more about the Testnet you can check out our post on
"[What is Testnet?]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html)".

## Summary of Testnet-0

In September 2022, we [launched]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/09/24/testnet-0-launched.html) our first Testnet.
The purpose of this Testnet was to
check the [consensus protocol](https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/protocol/),
test different [transaction](https://pactus.org/learn/transaction/format/) types,
and ensure the stability of the blockchain.
We also wanted to test the [sortition algorithm](https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/sortition/)
to make sure it works properly.

The [committee](https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/committee/)
for the Testnet-0 was set to five validators, and more than 19 validators joined during the Testnet period.
**Over 2 million blocks were created, and more than 3.2 million transactions were processed during this time.
The size of the blockchain is approximately 1 gigabyte.
The maximum number of transactions recorded in a single block was 386**. With a block time of 10 seconds,
we can confirm that Pactus blockchain can support up to 30 transactions per second (TPS),
which is a reasonable number for TPS. Based on real-time statistics available at [realtps](https://realtps.net/),
we can see that Pactus is among the top 10 blockchains in terms of TPS.

At this point, the development team decided to **end the Testnet-0** and move on to the next one,
Testnet-1. We are planning to run the Testnet-1 to prepare for the MainNet launch.
We will provide updates on our progress and share the details of the new Testnet soon.

As promised, **participants in Testnets will be given priority as validators for the MainNet**,
and will receive bounty tokens from the bootstrap accounts to set up their validator.
We are grateful to all those who participated in Testnet-0, and we encourage them to join our next Testnet to
help us improve Pactus.
As a community-based project, we rely on the support of our community members, and we value any help we receive.
