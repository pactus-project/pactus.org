## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.20.0](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.20.0)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

### Validator Stake Management

The new GUI application enables users to easily Unbond and Withdraw their validator's stake.

### Improving Network Connectivity

Some users have reported that UDP packets are being dropped by their Internet Service Providers.
Therefore, the UDP protocol is disabled by default.
Users can still activate the UDP protocol by configuring the settings in the file if necessary.

Also, the experimental Node Gossip feature has been removed in this version.
Node gossip could cause some validators to become isolated from the rest of the network.

### Relay service

This version enables users to turn their node into a relay service.
A relay service node can help users behind NAT to communicate with each other.
It is disabled by default and can be enabled inside the config file.
Please note that it is still in an experimental state.
