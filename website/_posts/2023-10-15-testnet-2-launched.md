## Overview

Exciting news for the Pactus Community: Testnet-2 is has launched!
The journey through [Testnet-1]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/08/01/story-of-testnet-1.html) brought success and invaluable experiences,
with over 500 validators joining the network.
Despite its noteworthy achievements, it also faced challenges that led to a tough decision: to pause the Testnet and
thoroughly address these issues.
After two months of dedicated work and testing, many problems have been resolved, and we feel confident launching the Testnet again.
Testnet-2 comes with substantial improvements compared to its predecessor by enhancing the core of the Pactus Blockchain.
Notably, the new consensus mechanism and improved overall network performance.

At this point, we want to assure the Pactus community that this version of **the Testnet will not stop until the mainnet launches**, and our main focus is on improving its overall performance and launching the Mainnet.
