## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.12.0](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.12.0)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

This version is focused on improving the sync time to make it faster.
This is achieved by implementing a caching mechanism that executes transactions more quickly and
improves the calculation of total power (stake) of the blockchain in a more effective way.
