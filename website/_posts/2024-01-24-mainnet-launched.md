## Years to Launch

Pactus Mainnet started creating the first block on 24 Janary 2024 at 20:24:10 UTC time.
Pactus Mainnet is the result of years of hard work, research, and innovation.
It started from one idea:

<b>A low-cost, truly decentralized blockchain, built by the people for the people,
where anyone could run and be their own validator.</b>

We faced many challenges and obstacles along the way, but we never gave up.<br>
We overcame them with our determination and perseverance.<br>
We learned from our mistakes and improved our solutions.<br>
We grew from a small team to a large community.<br>
We achieved many milestones and breakthroughs. And we did it. <br>
We created Pactus, the platform that empowers you.<br>
