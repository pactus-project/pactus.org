## Highlights

### Rate limit

This version applies a rate limit to the messages in the general topics including blocks and transactions.
This will help nodes to manage the network traffic in times of network congestion or spam attacks.

### Dynamic fee

To prevent attackers from sending spam transactions, a dynamic fee model is introduced in this patch.
Each node can define a minimum fee that is defaulted to 0.000001 PAC.
However, if the transaction pool becomes full, the transaction fee can increase up to 1 PAC.

To ensure network stability and security,
it is recommended that all validators upgrade to this version as soon as they can.
