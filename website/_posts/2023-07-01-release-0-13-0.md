## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.13.0](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

Users can now restore the `default_wallet` during the node initialization.
If users have a backup of the seed phrase (mnemonic) for the `default_wallet`,
they can now restore it and re-initialize the node.
