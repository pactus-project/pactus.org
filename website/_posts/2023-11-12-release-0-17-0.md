## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.17.0](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.17.0)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

<span style="color:red">The Testnet has been upgraded and all validators must update their nodes.</span>

This version will address major networking issues, reduce network usage, and improve overall performance.

A new node type, "**Node Gossips**", has been introduced to help broadcast and spread messages across the network.
Node Gossips support the network by delivering messages to non-gossiping nodes.
This gossip option is disabled by default but can be enabled in the configuration file.
If you are running Pactus on a stable and reliable server, we recommend enabling this option for your node.
Please note that this option is still experimental and subject to potential changes in future releases.
