## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.19.0](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.19.0)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

This version has improved the overall performance of the blockchain by implementing
[PIP-15](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-15).
PIP-15 suggests to add caching algorithms to the database for the most frequently used items.

Additionally, this version has enhanced the connectivity of the nodes in the P2P network.

### Availability Score

This version comes with the implementation of [PIP-19](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-19).
PIP-19 suggests assigning the "Availability Score" to each validator based on their activities in the
[committee](https://pactus.org/learn/consensus/committee/).
Validators with a score less than 0.8 won't receive the block reward,
as their proposals will be rejected by other validators.
The main reason behind this PIP is to prevent users from downgrading
their node specifications and running Pactus on machines with low resources.

### Breaking change

The Docker container now contains both daemon and wallet binary files.
Users who use Docker to run Pacts now need to add the entry point to run Pactus.
