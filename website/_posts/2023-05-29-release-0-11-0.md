## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.11.0](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.11.0)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

The main update in this version is the fix for the [relay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/circuit-relay/)
connection issue.
A relay is a peer in the network that facilitates the connection between two peers,
particularly when they are using home internet.

Another significant update is that sending a [Bond transaction]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/transaction/bond/)
is now more user-friendly.
Users no longer need to set the validator public key if they want to bond Test PAC coins to their validators.
