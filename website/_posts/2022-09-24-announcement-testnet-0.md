The Pactus blockchain Testnet-0 is now accessible.
To participate, simply [download]({{ site.baseurl }}/download) the Pactus application version 0.9.0 and
connect to the Testnet without any special configurations.
For test coins, please visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/H5vZkNnXCu) channel and share your validator address.

By taking part in the Testnet, you can familiarize yourself with the Pactus blockchain and
get ready for the mainnet launch.
**Testnet participants will also be given higher priority during the mainnet launch.**

Please share your feedback with us to help improve the user experience in future versions of the software.
