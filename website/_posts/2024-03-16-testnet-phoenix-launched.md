The public and permanent Phoenix [Testnet](https://pactus.org/2023/03/01/what-is-testnet.html)
for the Pactus blockchain has been launched.
This Testnet serves as a valuable platform for developers to thoroughly examine their projects,
providing a safe playground to test and deploy their applications before transitioning to the Mainnet.

All parameters within the Testnet mirror those of the Mainnet,
ensuring a consistent environment for testing and development.
The genesis block for the Testnet is available
[here](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/blob/main/genesis/testnet.json).

Currently, there are four active nodes running the Testnet, accessible at the following addresses:

- testnet1.pactus.org
- testnet2.pactus.org
- testnet3.pactus.org
- testnet4.pactus.org

The Testnet's name, Phoenix, was chosen by the Pactus community from various suggestions.
It embodies the spirit of rebirth and renewal, highlighting the innovative and testing-focused nature of the network.
Developers can utilize the [RoboPAC](https://github.com/robopac-project/RoboPac) as a faucet to receive test coins and
thoroughly test their applications within this environment.
It's important to note that the coins within this Testnet hold no monetary value and are only meant for testing purpose.

All addresses within the Phoenix network are prefixed with `tpc1...`,
distinguishing them from Mainnet addresses that start with `pc1...`'.
This clear differentiation streamlines development and ensures seamless integration when transitioning to
the Mainnet environment.
