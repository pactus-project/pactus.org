## Highlights

This version prevents spamming transactions by defining a minimum value per transaction.
It is not part of the consensus parameters,
and each node can set its own threshold.
By default, it is set to 0.1 PAC.

The version also bans validators that were part of the recent spam attack on the network.
Their stake will be frozen at block 820,000.

**Validators must update their nodes to this version as soon as possible.**
