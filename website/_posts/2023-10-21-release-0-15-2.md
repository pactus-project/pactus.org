## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.15.2](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.15.2)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

This version allows nodes to set limits on the number of connections they can establish.
By default, each node can have a minimum of 8 connections and a maximum of 16 connections.
Users can easily change these numbers in the configuration file.
