## Abstract

A few days ago, we published announcements on Pactus Socials regarding PIPs (Pactus Improvement Proposals) and Pactus Labs.

### What is a PIP?

In this section, we will explain what a PIP is and how it benefits Pactus.
Many projects in the tech world utilize similar conventions like BIP, EIP, PEP, and so on.

These acronyms stand for:

* [Bitcoin Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips)
* [Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs)
* [Python Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/python/peps)
* [Nostr Improvement Possibilities](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips)

These are specifications that guide projects in their improvement efforts.
They are often numbered, such as PIP-1, PIP-2, etc.

### PIPs Repository

These specifications help steer the direction of a project.
They are usually assigned unique numbers like PIP-1, PIP-2, and so on.

Anyone can propose these for any project.

Currently, Pactus Improvement Proposals can be found [here](https://pips.pactus.org/).
