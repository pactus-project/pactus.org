### What is a PIP?

In this section, we will explain what a PIP is and how it benefits Pactus. 
Many projects in the tech world utilize similar conventions like BIP, EIP, PEP, and so on.

These acronyms stand for:

* Bitcoin Improvement Proposal
* Ethereum Improvement Proposal
* Python Enhancement Proposal
* Nostr Improvement Possibilities

These are specifications that guide projects in their improvement efforts. 
hey are often numbered, such as PIP-1, PIP-2, etc.

### PIPs Repository

These specifications help steer the direction of a project.
They are usually assigned unique numbers like PIP-1, PIP-2, and so on.

Anyone can propose these for any project.

Currently, Pactus Improvement Proposals can be found [here](https://github.com/pactus-project/PIPs).
