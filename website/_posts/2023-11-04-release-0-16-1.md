## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.16.1](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.16.1)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

In this version, the private IP address won't be advertised, and by default,
nodes try to find if they have any public IP address.
If so, they will advertise it. Users can also set the `public_address` in the config file.
This feature specifically helps users who have both public and private IP addresses to always advertise the public addresses.
Users can still use the private network if they enable the `force_private_network` option inside the config file.
Most users don't need to change their node's configuration.
