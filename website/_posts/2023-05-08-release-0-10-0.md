## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.10.0](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.10.0)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlight

The main update in this version allows users to set up multiple validators in one node.
Users can set up to 32 validators in a single node, and each validator can stake up to 1,000 coins.
