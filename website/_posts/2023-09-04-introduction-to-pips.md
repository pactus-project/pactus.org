## Introduction to PIPs

In our commitment to transparency and innovation, we're excited to introduce a major step in Pactus's journey:
the Pactus Improvement Proposals, or PIPs.

## What are PIPs?

Pactus Improvement Proposals (PIPs) define standards for the ongoing development and enhancement of the Pactus platform.
Each PIP has a unique number like [PIP-2](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-2),
[PIP-3](https://pips.pactus.org/PIPs/pip-3), and so on.
These proposals provide technical details for suggested modifications or enactments, serving as a guide for development.

## The PIP process

The PIP process is open, allowing any member of the Pactus community to propose a PIP.
The author should provide a summary, motivation, and a detailed technical explanation.
The Pactus Laboratory team will carefully review each PIP.
Security considerations must be addressed before finalizing a PIP.
Once finalized, it can be added to the code.
This process helps avoid unexpected issues during development and maintain consistency and safety.

## The Origins of PIPs

The Pactus Improvement Proposals (PIPs) was inspired by the
Ethereum Improvement Proposals ([EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs)) system,
which had its roots in the Bitcoin Improvement Proposals ([BIPs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips)) and
Python Enhancement Proposals ([PEPs](https://github.com/python/peps)).

## New Feature Policy

From now on, all major changes or new features in the Pactus project require a PIP.
Any implementation must reference its specific PIP.
Without approval from Pactus Laboratory team, changes won't be approved and added to the codebase.
