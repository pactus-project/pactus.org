## Overview

Pactus Blockchain [Version 0.18.0](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus/releases/tag/v0.18.0)
is now available for download.
This release includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that
is suitable for both beginners and experienced users.
It also includes a command-line interface (CLI) for advanced users and wallet software
that allows users to interact with the blockchain without the need to sync the entire blockchain.

## Highlights

This version has significantly improved the syncing progress.
The syncing process concurrently requests blocks from 8 different peers and
actively connects to the most optimal peers for downloading the blockchain.

Additionally, users can now import private keys into their wallet and securely encrypt them using their wallet password.

### Breaking change

For Unix-based systems, please note that the working directory for root users has changed from `/pactus` to `/root/pactus`.

## Download

This version has been implemented for [Testnet-2]({{ site.url }}/2023/10/15/testnet-2-launched.html) and
is being prepared for the upcoming Mainnet launch.
To start using Pactus Blockchain Testnet-2, download the latest version from the
[download]({{ site.baseurl }}/download) page and join the Testnet.
