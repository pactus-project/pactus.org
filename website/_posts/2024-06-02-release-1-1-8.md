## Highlights

This version aims to reduce the consensus message once there is a delay on block creation.
It also defines a fixed fee of 0.1 PAC for transactions.
This fixed fee will be replaced by a dynamic fee in future releases,
which will provide more flexibility and efficiency.

To ensure network stability and security,
it is recommended that all validators upgrade to this version as soon as they can.
