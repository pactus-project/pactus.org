### Linters

one of new changes in Pactus project is new linters we added this month.
what is linters?
linters are just a set of rules for the style of source codes, they force developers to write new codes
in correct, clean and safe way.

why we use them?
the reason we are using linters in Pactus and add new ones, is to make the code more safe,
and also make it easy to work on for new contributors because we are focus on being decentralized even in development.

### TLA+ spec

one another new change in Pactus is updating TLA+ spec, which is related to consensus,
