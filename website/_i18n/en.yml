  what_is:
    title: What is Pactus?
    sec_1_title: Pactus is a Blockchain focused on decentralization
    sec_1_desc: >
      Pactus is built on the principle that a fair and transparent system can only be achieved through decentralization.
      Unlike many other blockchain platforms, Pactus aims to eliminate the potential for centralization and manipulation
      by removing the need for delegation and miners.
      This allows anyone to become a part of the ecosystem and ensures that the platform remains truly decentralized.
    sec_2_title: Pactus is a user-friendly blockchain
    sec_2_desc: >
      Pactus aims to create a user-friendly blockchain that can be easily used by anyone, not just tech experts.
      Our protocol is designed to be simple, easy to maintain, and develop.
      Pactus offers a simple GUI application that makes it easy for users to run a node.
    sec_3_title: Pactus uses a percentage-based fee model
    sec_3_desc: >
      Transaction fees are calculated based on a percentage model with a minimum and maximum fee.
      These parameters provide greater control over the fee structure and prevent overpaying or underpaying.
      The percentage-based model ensures fairness and predictability, and can be adjusted through consensus among all validators.
    sec_4_title: Dedicated Decentralized Storage in Pactus
    sec_4_desc: >
      In Pactus, users can purchase a dedicated storage file that can be renewed annually,
      leading to reduced costs for storage and smart contract execution.
      This unique feature can pave the way for a new protocols in the decentralized platforms.

    welcome: >
      Welcome to the Pactus contribution page!
      We're glad you're interested in contributing to our open-source and community-driven project.
      Our goal is to create a secure and decentralized network that empowers individuals to participate
      in the network without the need for intermediaries.
      <br><br>
      There are several ways to support the Pactus project:
    run_a_node: Run a Node
    run_a_node_desc: >
      One of the most effective ways to contribute to the Pactus network is by running a node.
      A "node" is a software program that downloads a copy of the Pactus blockchain and helps maintain the network
      by validating transactions and blocks.
      By running a node, you help ensure the network remains secure and decentralized, as it reduces the risk of
      any one entity gaining too much control or influence over the network.
      <br><br>
      To run a Pactus node, you will need to have stake in the network, but there is no limit to the amount of stake you can have.
      Having your own node means you don't have to rely on a third-party to provide information about the state of the network,
      which increases your level of security and control over your interactions with the Pactus network.

      This FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page aims to provide helpful information and guidance on
      common questions and concerns related to Pactus.
    pactus_meaning: What does "Pactus" mean?
    pactus_meaning_answer_v1: >
      The word "Pactus" is of Latin origin and means "to agree together", "contract", or "transact".
      In English, the term "Pact" is derived from the Latin word "Pactus".
    pactus_vs_bitcoin: How is Pactus different from Bitcoin?
    pactus_vs_bitcoin_answer_v1: >
      Pactus and Bitcoin are two different types of blockchain networks.
      While Bitcoin uses a process called "Proof of Work" to secure its network, Pactus uses a different method called "Proof of Stake".
      This means that instead of mining, validators are responsible for voting on incoming blocks and
      must hold a certain amount of the network's token, known as "stake", as a security deposit to prevent malicious behavior.
    pactus_vs_ethereum: How is Pactus different from Ethereum?
    pactus_vs_ethereum_answer_v1: >
      Pactus and Ethereum are both Proof of Stake blockchains, but they differ in their approach to running a validator.
      Running a validator on Ethereum can be challenging and requires a minimum of 32 Ethereum coins to stake.
      In contrast, Pactus is designed to be more accessible to normal users.
      There is no minimum stake requirement, and you can run the Pactus node on any operating system with basic hardware.
      This approach reflects our commitment to promoting decentralization and making blockchain technology accessible to a wider audience.
    validators: What are validators?
    validators_answer_v1: >
      Validators on Pactus are responsible for processing transactions and creating blocks and, by doing so,
      helping to secure the network and keep it decentralized.
      They use their own coins as a stake to ensure the network's security and receive rewards for their contributions.
    validators_rewarded: How do validators get rewarded?
    validators_rewarded_answer_v1: >
      Once a validator proposes a valid block and it is accepted by the network, the validator receives one coin as a block reward.
      The reward is an incentive given to validators for their contribution to the security and integrity of the network,
      helping to keep it running smoothly.
    flat_reward: How much is the block reward in Pactus?
    flat_reward_answer_v1: >
      Block reward in Pactus is fixed, and it is always one coin per block.
      This flat reward scheme helps to ensure simplicity, fairness and better coin distribution.
    unlimited_validators: How many validators does pactus have?
    unlimited_validators_answer_v1: >
      Pactus is a real Proof of Stake blockchain, which means there is no limit on the number of validators in the network.
      However, a committee of 21 validators is responsible for creating blocks.
      It's important to note that the committee members are not fixed and they change over time.
    min_and_max_stake: What are the minimum and maximum amounts I can stake?
    min_and_max_stake_answer_v1: >
      In Pactus, there is no minimum limit for staking coins, but the maximum amount you can stake is 12381 coins.
      If you want to stake more than 12381 coins, you can run a new validator.
      Running multiple validators keeps the network more decentralized and helps maintain its security and stability.
    total_supply: What is the total supply of Pactus coins?
    total_supply_answer_v1: >
      Pactus has a total supply of 21 million coins, and each coin is divided into 1 billion units.
      Every 10 seconds, a new coin is generated, resulting in 8,640 new coins per day and about 3 million per year.
      All coins will be generated within 7 years.
    unique_blockchain: Is Pactus a copy of any other blockchain?
    unique_blockchain_answer_v1: >
      No, Pactus is not a copy or a derivative of any other blockchain.
      It is a new and unique blockchain protocol that has been designed from scratch.
      The consensus mechanism used in Pactus is unique and specifically created to solve the scalability issue of
      validators in the Proof of Stake blockchains.
    treasury_account: What is the Treasury account?
    treasury_account_answer_v1: >
      The Treasury account is a special account in Pactus blockchain that holds the total supply of coins, which is 21 million coins.
      It is created at the genesis time and has no key pair associated with it, meaning it cannot be accessed or controlled by anyone.
      Every time a block is created, one coin from the Treasury account transfers to the proposer account as a block reward.
    without_ico: Does Pactus have an ICO?
    without_ico_answer_v1: >
      No, Pactus does not have an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and there are no predefined or privileged accounts in pactus.
      The Pactus blockchain starts from zero and all coins are minted through the consensus mechanism.
      This ensures that the distribution of coins is fair and there is no centralization of wealth.
    fee_model: How are transaction fees calculated in Pactus?
    fee_model_answer_v1: >
      Transaction fees in Pactus are calculated using a percentage-based fee model.
      This means that the fee is a percentage of the transferred amount, with a minimum and maximum fee.
      The percentage, minimum fee, and maximum fee parameters are part of the blockchain parameters and
      can be changed through a agreement upon all validators.
    fee_min_max: What is the minimum and maximum fee?
    fee_min_max_answer_v1: >
      These parameters are designed to provide greater control over the fee structure and ensure that fees remain within a certain range.
      If the calculated fee for a transaction falls below the minimum fee, the minimum fee is used instead.
      Similarly, if the calculated fee exceeds the maximum fee, the maximum fee is used instead.
      This helps prevent users from overpaying or underpaying for transactions and provides greater predictability and fairness
      in the fee structure.
    why_percentage_fee: Why was a percentage-based fee model chosen for Pactus?
    why_percentage_fee_answer_v1: >
      The percentage-based fee model was chosen for Pactus because it provides a more equitable and predictable fee structure for users,
      as fees are proportional to the transferred amount.
      It also allows for greater flexibility in adjusting the fee structure to better align with the needs of the blockchain and its users,
      as the percentage, minimum fee, and maximum fee parameters can be changed through a consensus mechanism agreed upon by all validators.
    why_develop_pactus: Why was  Pactus developed?
    why_develop_pactus_answer_v1: >
      Pactus was developed with the goal of scaling blockchain without compromising security and decentralization.
      To achieve this, Pactus utilizes a unique consensus mechanism that enables the creation of blocks in just 10 seconds.
      Moreover, Pactus was designed to be more accessible to all users, regardless of their technical expertise or financial resources.
      <br><br>
      Our commitment to decentralization and fairness is reflected in our decision to start the Pactus blockchain from zero and
      ensure that all coins are minted through the consensus mechanism, rather than through an ICO or privileged accounts.
    what_pactus_solved: What problems does Pactus solve that other blockchains don't?
    what_pactus_solved_answer_v1: >
      Pactus tries to solve several problems faced by other blockchain networks,
      including scalability, accessibility, fairness in distribution and storage cost.
      <br><br>
      <b>Scalability:</b>
      Pactus has a unique consensus mechanism that is specifically designed to address the scalability issue
      without sacrificing the security and decentralization.
      <br><br>
      <b>Accessibility:</b>
      Running a validator on Pactus is designed to be more accessible to normal users compared to other blockchains.
      <br><br>
      <b>Fairness in distribution:</b>
      Pactus has a fair and transparent coin distribution model, aiming to prevent the concentration of wealth.
      <br><br>
      <b>Storage cost:</b>
      Pactus offers a novel storage solution by allowing users to allocate dedicated storage files,
      reducing storage costs and simplifying the smart contracts.
    how_pactus_words: How does Pactus blockchain work?
    how_pactus_words_answer_v1: >
      Pactus operates with a committee of validators who are responsible for creating new blocks.
      The committee consists of 21 validators, however, the members of the committee change randomly over time.
      Every 10 seconds, a validator in the committee known as the proposer collects all the valid transactions, adds them into a block,
      and shares it with other validators in the committee.
      If more than ⅔ of the stakeholders in the committee attest to the proposed block by signing it, the block gets committed and
      all the transactions inside the block will be executed.
      This process repeats every 10 seconds.
    how_enter_committee: How can a validator enter to the committee?
    how_enter_committee_answer_v1: >
      To enter the committee in Pactus, validators can participate in a lottery or sortition process that occurs at each block.
      In this process, validators generate a provable random number between zero to total stake, and if the number is less than their stake,
      they can send a transaction known as sortition transaction with the proof of sortition.
      Once the sortition transaction is included in a block and added to the blockchain, the validator becomes a committee member,
      and the oldest committee member leaves.
    fork_possibility: Is it possible to have two valid blocks at the same time?
    fork_possibility_answer_v1: >
      It is not possible to have two valid blocks at the same time in Pactus blockchain.
      The consensus algorithm in Pactus prevents the possibility of having two block proposers at the same time.
      This ensures that there will be no fork in the network.
    multiple_committee_entry: Can multiple validators enter the committee at once?
    multiple_committee_entry_answer_v1: >
      The process of sortition in Pactus is random, so it's possible for more than one validator to enter the committee at once,
      or no validator at all. However, in order for a sortition transaction to be considered valid and included in a block,
      it must meet two conditions:
      it can't change more than ⅓ of the committee's stake, and
      it can't remove a validator that hasn't had the chance to propose a block yet.
    proposer_selection: How are block proposers selected in the committee?
    proposer_selection_answer_v1: >
      The block proposer inside the committee is selected based on the time they entered the committee.
      This means that the selection process follows a first-come, first-propose order.
    send_transaction: What is a Send transaction?
    send_transaction_answer_v1: >
      A send transaction is a type of transaction that allows users to transfer Pactus coin from one address to another.
    bond_transaction: What is a Bond transaction?
    bond_transaction_answer_v1: >
      A bond transaction is a type of transaction that allows you to become a validator by staking some coins.
      When you send a bond transaction, your node will become a validator and you will be weighted by the amount of stake you have.
    sortition_transaction: What is a Sortition transaction?
    sortition_transaction_answer_v1: >
      A sortition transaction is a type of transaction that allows validators to enter the committee.
    unbond_transaction: What is an Unbond transaction?
    unbond_transaction_answer_v1: >
      An unbond transaction is a type of transaction that allows you to unbond your validator.
      When you send an unbond transaction, you will no longer be able to send the sortition or bond transactions.
    withdraw_transaction: What is a Withdraw transaction?
    withdraw_transaction_answer_v1: >
      A withdraw transaction is a type of transaction that allows a validator to withdraw their staked tokens from the network.
