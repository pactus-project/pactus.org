  faq_how_is_pactus_different_from_bitcoin: How is Pactus different from Bitcoin?
  faq_how_is_pactus_different_from_bitcoin_answer_v1: >
    Pactus is a Proof of Stake blockchain, unlike Bitcoin that is a Proof of Work blockchain. It means there is mining in pactus.
    The blockchain is secured by the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. In Proof of Stake, Validators vote for incoming blocks.
    These votes are weighted by the Validators' stake. Once a validator proposes a valid block and the block accepted by other validators, it receives one coin as reward.

  faq_how_is_pactus_different_from_ethereum_answer_v1: >
    Ethereum is a real Proof of Stake Blockchain same as Pactus, however running a validator in Ethereum is not easy.
    In Pactus everyone with minimum knowledge of blockchain and minimum hardware joins the network.
    Unlike Ethereum there is no minimum stake and you don't need to run the node inside the cloud platform.
    You can run the node in any Operating System with minimum hardware. We truly believe in decentralization.
  faq_what_are_validators: What are validators?
  faq_what_are_validators_answer_v1: >
    Validators in proof-of-stake blockchains are like miners in proof-of-work blockchain.
    Validators on Pactus are responsible to processing transactions and creating blocks and, by doing so, helping secure the network.<br>
    Anyone can become a validator on Pactus by depositing (staking) some coins.
  faq_how_do_validators_get_rewarded: How do validators get rewarded?
  faq_how_do_validators_get_rewarded_answer_v1: >
    Every 10 seconds, one validator is responsible for collecting transactions and creating a block.
    The first transaction in the proposed block is called the “reward” transaction.
    The amount of reward transaction is the sum of one coin as block reward and transaction fees.
    If the majority of committee members attest for the proposed block, the block will be committed and the validator gets rewarded.
