As an open-source platform, Pactus blockchain empowers from its community.
Whether you're a developer, designer, or enthusiast, your contributions can make a meaningful impact.

There are several ways to support the Pactus project:

## Run a Node

One of the most effective ways to contribute to the Pactus network is by running a node.
A "node" is a software program that downloads a copy of the Pactus blockchain and
ensure the network keeps running safe and decentralized.

These guides can help you to run and configure your node:

- [{% t dict.guide.run_pactus_gui %}]({{ site.baseurl }}/user-guides/run-pactus-gui)
- [{% t dict.guide.run_pactus_cli %}]({{ site.baseurl }}/user-guides/run-pactus-cli)
- [{% t dict.guide.run_pactus_docker %}]({{ site.baseurl }}/user-guides/run-pactus-docker)

## Become a Validator

Validators play an important role in the Pactus blockchain by verifying transactions and
adding them to the blockchain.
By becoming a validator, you can earn [rewards]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/blockchain/incentive/)
for contributing to the network's security and decentralization.

To become a validator, you will need to stake a certain amount of Pactus coins.
These guides can help you to send a Bond transaction and stake some coins:

- [{% t dict.guide.send_transactions_gui %}]({{ site.baseurl }}/user-guides/send-transactions-gui)
- [{% t dict.guide.send_transactions_cli %}]({{ site.baseurl }}/user-guides/send-transactions-cli)
